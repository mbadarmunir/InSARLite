**For step-by-step instructions**, we strongly recommend following the comprehensive:

### [🏔️ Turkey Landslide Case Study Tutorial](../tutorials/turkey-case-study.md)

This tutorial provides complete, screenshot-guided instructions for every aspect of InSAR processing with InSARLite:

- Installation and setup (8 screenshots)
- Project configuration (14 screenshots)  
- Baseline network design (9 screenshots)
- Interferogram generation (3 screenshots)
- Phase unwrapping (20 screenshots)
- SBAS analysis (6 screenshots)
- Results visualization (2 screenshots)

**Processing real research data** (60 Sentinel-1 acquisitions), this tutorial demonstrates InSARLite's capabilities for detecting precursory deformation before catastrophic slope failures.

## Reference Documentation

### [Overview](overview.md)

Conceptual architecture and design principles from the InSARLite research paper:

- Platform requirements and installation
- Four-step processing workflow
- Network centrality algorithms
- SBAS inversion methodology
- Key innovations and modifications to GMTSAR workflow

## Future Documentation

Additional user guide sections covering specific topics (data management, baseline planning, unwrapping techniques, SBAS configuration, export formats, troubleshooting) will be added in future releases. For now, the Turkey tutorial provides comprehensive coverage of all these topics in context.
